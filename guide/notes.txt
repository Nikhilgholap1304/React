Virtual Dom was react's own tree

Hidration is the process of injecting the javascript in to an web template.

The fibre is an algorithm which updates the virtual dom.

Reconciliation is an algorithm behind virtual dom.

Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM." A high-level description goes something like this: when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. This tree is then flushed to the rendering environment — for example, in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM operations. When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.

  In simpler words - Reconcilation is an algorthm which is used to mount the virtual dom.
Whenever state has changed it generates new tree and will only try to modify the dom according to the difference it finds between browsers DOM and reacts virtual DOM and not the entire of browsers DOM like github commits and changes.
Hence react is pretty much optimized because it selectively update the changes not the entire DOM via virtual DOM.

DOM is nothing but one of the rendering environments react can render to 

Props makes the component reusable


useCallback
useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)
Reference
useCallback(fn, dependencies)
Usage
Skipping re-rendering of components
Updating state from a memoized callback
Preventing an Effect from firing too often
Optimizing a custom Hook

On the initial render, useCallback returns the fn function you have passed.
During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn  function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render

//IMP
The useCallback and useMemo Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function.
The React useCallback Hook returns a memoized callback function.
Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
This allows us to isolate resource intensive functions so that they will not automatically run on every render.
The useCallback Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update

//IMP
The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.
It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.
It can be used to access a DOM element directly.

Does Not Cause Re-renders
If we tried to count how many times our application renders using the useState Hook, we would be caught in an infinite loop since this Hook itself causes a re-render.

To avoid this, we can use the useRef Hook.
const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");
  const count = useRef(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    count.current = count.current + 1;
  });

In general, we want to let React handle all DOM manipulation.
But there are some instances where useRef can be used without causing issues.
In React, we can add a ref attribute to an element to access it directly in the DOM.
